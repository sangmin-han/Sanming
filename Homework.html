<h1>"Shoot me instead of him." Kneeling Myanmar nun.</h1>
<br>
<br>

<p>
  According to the Guardian on the 9th (local time), Sister An Rose Nuthaung (nun Rose), a member of St. Francis Saberio's convent<br>
   in Michini City, Myanmar, knelt in front of heavily armed military police and begged them not to take their children's lives.
  "I knelt<br> down and begged her not to shoot or torture the children, but rather kill me," Rose told the newspaper.
  <br>
  <br>Myanmar's military has been cracking down on civilians, including live ammunition and tear gas, after a February 1 coup.
  Citizens<br> took to the streets with helmets and homemade shields in Michini, northern Myanmar. Myanmar's military and police
   began to<br> flock around the protesters to suppress them.<br>
   <br>
  Rose and two other nuns begged to go to the police and go somewhere else. Some military and police officers were seen listening<br>
   to the nun when Sister Rose knelt down, kneeling down and listened to the nun.
   <br>
   <br>
   But while Rose was on her knees, the military and police began shooting at the protesters behind her. Eventually, a man was 
  shot<br> and killed in front of Sister Rose.
  Sister Rose told the newspaper, "The children ran to the front in embarrassment. "I had no choice<br> but to pray to God to 
  save them without doing anything."

    <h2>Have European countries made a mistake in halting AstraZeneca shots? 
        Here's what health experts say</h2>
    <p>London (CNN)Within the space of a few days, the rollout of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19
      vaccine has ground to a standstill in virtually all of western Europe.</p>
    
      <p>France, Spain, Germany, Italy and more than a dozen other countries have paused rollout of the shot, 
      calling it a precautionary measure following concerns that it could be linked to blood clots; decisions that go against the advice of global health agencies.</p>
      
      <p></p>A few countries have stood by the vaccine -- including the United Kingdom, where more than 11 
      million doses have already been administered, and where real-world data has shown vaccines are 
      reducing infections and hospitalizations.</p>

    <h2>UK labels Russia top security threat, issues warning on China,

    <p>(CNN)Russia is Britain's top security challenge, the UK will build more nuclear 
      weapons and London will expand its presence in the high-tech realms of space and 
      cyberspace, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced Tuesday in a sweeping review 
      of British military and foreign policy.</p>
      
    <p>To accomplish its goals, the British government wants to increase defense spending
       by £24 billion ($33.3 billion) over the next four years, a large increase on the 
       £42.2 billion it spent in 2019-2020.</p>
      
      <p> The government also pledged tens of billions of pounds in investment in other areas,
       including £15 billion for research and development for science and technology, 
       more than £17 billion to fight climate change and promote biodiversity, 
       and £13 billion in the fight against the coronavirus.</p>

<h2 style="font-size:39px; color:blue;">South Korea's first asteroid exploration target, Apophis, <br>has been spotted near Earth.</h2>
<p style="font-size:30px; color:green;"> Poor access to Earth - 43 times as much distance between the moon.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align:right;">Enter article 2021.03.11 PM 6:11</p>
<img src="test.jpg"
style="float:left;width:550px;height:320px;">
<p>The 370-meter-diameter asteroid Apophis approached nearly<br> 16.8 million kilometers 
from Earth at 10:15 a.m. on the 6th of<br> this month in Korean time and passed near 
the Earth at 4.58<br> kilometers per second. It approached 43 times the distance<br> between 
the Earth and the moon, and passed by.</p>

<p>The Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute succeeded<br> in observing and releasing
the video on the 10th of this<br> month through tracking and observation using 
the 'OWL-Net'<br> from February.</p>


<p>Asteroid Apophis is a celestial body that has been constantly<br> threatened 
by Earth's collision since it was first discovered in<br> 2004. It is expected 
to pass at 6:46 on April 14, 2029 at a<br> distance of approximately 37,000 km,
very close to Earth.</p>

<p style="font-size: 12px;">Video capture an asteroid Apophis.</p>

<p>The observational video of Apophis, released by the Korea Astronomy and
Space Science Institute, was taken at OWL-Net No. 4 at<br> the Lemon Mountain 
Observatory in Arizona.</p>

<p>The Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute is conducting preliminary
research on asteroid exploration missions, especially with<br> the aim of directly 
exploring Apophis in 2029. The fact that an asteroid approaches the Earth means 
that only a small amount of fuel<br> provides good conditions for the probe to reach
the asteroid.</p>
